This work is copyrighted by Hashem Nasarat under the Creative Commons Attribution-ShareAlike license. Its roots are historical and its presence in commonplace. Virtually any poster, map, book, article, movie, TV show, and app that one sees on an everyday basis are protected by copyright law. To put it simply, copyright is the legally sanctioned monopoly to control the redistribution, creation of derivatives or performance of a creative work for a limited period of time, in order to ensure economic benefit to the creator.  Copyright is an everyday occurrence that has nuanced underpinnings. Upon examination of current trends in copyright, it become evident that a war of opinions is raging. 

The earliest known form of copyright comes from a 1469 Venetian manuscript, which grants a five-year printing monopoly in all of Venice to and by the request of one person.

Another influential document on copyright is the Statute of Anne an 18th century British act, which is notable for regulating copyright by the general legal system (as opposed to by exception). The act reads, "the Author of any Book ... shall have the sole liberty of printing and reprinting such Book and Books for the term of fourteen years to commence from the day of the first publishing the same".

Thus, it can be seen from the changes between the Venetian manuscript and the British statute how common opinion on copyright changed between these years.  Specifically, the statute allowed protections for all books, yielded the rights to copying to authors rather than publishers, and extended the length of the priviledge.  

British notions of copyright influenced the United States Constitution as well. The constitition includes the following power of Congress: "The Congress shall have Power ... To promote the Progress of Science and useful Arts, by securing for limited Times to Authors and Inventors the exclusive Right to their respective Writings and Discoveries;" http://www.copyright.gov/title17/92chap1.html#106)

In the 19th century, (and revised throughout the 20th), the Berne Convention was drafted which is an international agreement concerning the multi-national copyright laws. The Berne Convention is one of the most important documents shaping modern copyright. In it, the notion of automatic protection was established (which obviates the need to register to have a work protected), as well as the agreement upon respecting copyright granted in foreign countries. Furthermore, the minimum length of copyright is set to the authors life, plus an additional fifty years. Signed countries must adhere to these tenants. In the late 19th century, a bureau was set up to administer the administration of the Berne Convention. In 1967 the bureau became the World Intellectual Property Organization (WIPO), an agency of the United Nations.  Since its creation, 166 countries have signed the Berne Convention. This spread has been furthered by the World Trade Organization (WTO), an organization which regulates a framework for negotiating international trade agreements. In 1994 WTO adopted the Agreement on Trade Related Aspects of Intellectual Property Rights (TRIPS), a treaty which contains and expands upon the Berne Convention rules, as one of its basic principles required by all participating countries.

The trend in the past five hundred years, leading up to the modern notion of copyright, has been to expand and spread the power of copyright. This has been accomplished by international agreements and tying copyright law to other economic benefits such as World Trade Organization membership.

Despite the apparent complete acceptance of WTO copyright law in the international scene, the concept is not without its opponents. On a broad level, groups such as the anti-globalization movement have protested the global spread of neoliberalism (the belief that governments should ensure protect mercantile liberty for individuals and corporations) through international trade agreements, like those set up by WTO.  http://www.anti-marketing.com/anti-globalization.html

Some groups are more specifically oriented against the typical notion of WTO copyright law. For example, organizations like Creative Commons have saught to, in essence, turn copyright on its head and exploit the system to ensure the unbridled spread of creative works and information, rather than the typical use-case of a publisher or creative author being the sole distributor of a work. To ensure the right to redistribute information, Creative Commons used a clever exploit of copyright law, known as copyleft. By explicitly stating the terms by which a work may be used, creators can copyright their work with a copyleft license, which is a legal assurance that consumers have the permission to redistribute the work works. Under the terms of most copyleft-licensed work, consumers may redistribute and alter the work, but must pass along the same license. Such works are known as free content. A common misconception is that the word "free" refers to price, but in actuality, it is a reference to the freedom to redistribute which is ensured by a specific copyright license. Groups like the Createive Commons are part of the free culture movement, a worldwide social movement that objects to
restrictive copyright laws.

Throughout history, copyright has gone through many changes and iterations. Of note is the global strengthening it saw in the 20th century with the berne convention, TRIPS, and the WTO. Simultaneously, however, there has been considerable push-back from grassroots organizations that object to the restrictions placed. Using copyleft, these groups serve as a real-world example to the possibilities of copyright in new forms. Copyright law is a contemporary issue which is ever-changing and has widespread impact. The movies we see, the programs we use and the works we create are and will be impacted by the multitude of legal cases, protests, and discussions which are ongoing.
